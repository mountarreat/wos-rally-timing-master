# Rally Timing Master

The **Rally Timing Master** is a simple tool designed to help players coordinate rallies in Whiteout Survival by calculating the optimal launch times for multiple leaders. This ensures that rallies land at the same time, maximizing the effectiveness of your coordinated attacks.

## Features
- Input leader names and rally times
- Automatically calculates the optimal rally launch times
- Displays launch schedule for each leader in UTC

## Usage
1. Enter the name of each rally leader.
2. Input the rally walking duration for each leader in the format `min:sec`.
3. Set the start time for the suicide rally (the rally to hit first).
4. The tool will calculate and display the exact UTC launch times for each leader.

## Example
If you input the following:
- **Leader 1**: Rally time of 1:03
- **Leader 2**: Rally time of 1:02
- **Leader 3**: Suicide rally with a time of 1:50

And set the suicide rally launch time to `19:20:00 UTC`, the tool will output:
- **Leader 1**: Launch at 19:20:48 UTC
- **Leader 2**: Launch at 19:20:49 UTC
- **Leader 3**: Launch at 19:20:00 UTC (Suicide Rally)
